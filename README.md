ObjCMongoDB is a Mac OS and iOS library for [MongoDB][] and [BSON][] based on
the [10gen C driver][mongo-c-driver].

## Latest release

The latest release is v0.9.6.

 -   Based on v0.7.1 of the driver
 -   Now supports iOS!
 -   Works under OS X 10.6 â€“ 10.8 and iOS 6.1 (probably early versions too)
 -   Works both with and without support for ARC
 
```sh
git checkout v0.9.6     # since master may be a work in process
```

See what's changed in [History][].

## Getting started

Refer to the installation instructions and sample code on the
[wiki][]:

 -   [Getting started using ObjCMongoDB in your Mac OS project][GettingStarted]
 -   [The basics of using ObjCMongoDB][TheBasics]

## Features

 -   Simple BSON encoding and decoding, using dictionaries.

 -   Built-in support for arrays, dictionaries, embedded objects, strings,
     numbers, dates, object IDs, and the miscellaneous MongoDB types.

 -   More complex encoding and decoding based on NSCoder's keyed coding
     scheme. A robust delegate interface lets you implement encoding and
     decoding entirely outside the model classes if necessary.
   
 -   Automatically encodes and decodes Core Data entities. Using the coder's
     delegate interface you can customize the default behavior, or simply
     implement alternate behavior it in the entity class.

 -   Aims to feel Cocoa-like, not Mongo-like. For example, method names in
     MongoKeyedPredicate and MongoUpdateRequest are natural in Cocoa, though
     they don't conform to the underlying Mongo keywords.
