An Objective-C library for BSON and MongoDB based on the 10gen C driver.

STATUS

Mostly complete. Waiting for ensure index, more .h documentation, sample code, write
concerns, more test cases, and some commands.

INSTALLATION

Refer to the wiki: https://github.com/noa--/ObjCMongoDB/wiki/GettingStarted

FEATURES

 * BSON encoding and decoding based on NSCoder's keyed coding scheme. When necessary,
   encoding and decoding can be implemented entirely outside the model classes with
   help from robust delegate interfaces.
   
 * Built-in support for arrays, dictionaries, embedded objects, strings, numbers,
   dates, object IDs, and the miscellaneous MongoDB types.

 * Automatically encodes and decodes Core Data entities. Using the coder's delegate
   interface you can customize the default behavior, or simply override it in the
   entity class.

 * Feels Cocoa-like, not Mongo-like. For example, method names in MongoKeyedPredicate
   and MongoUpdateRequest are quite different from the underlying Mongo keywords.
